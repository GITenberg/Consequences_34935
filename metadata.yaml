description: "Unintended Consequences is a novel by John Ross, first published in\
  \ 1996 by Accurate Press. The story chronicles the history of the gun culture, gun\
  \ rights, and gun control in the United States from the early 1900s through the\
  \ late 1990s. Although clearly a work of fiction, the story is heavily laced with\
  \ historical fact, including historical figures who play minor supporting roles.\
  \ The protagonist is very active in competitive shooting sports, as is the author;\
  \ so unusually detailed and intricate facts, figures and explanations of firearms-related\
  \ topics, ornament the narrative and drive the plot.\nThe cover has a picture of\
  \ Lady Justice being assaulted by an ATF agent.\nThe book was listed by The New\
  \ York Times' Sunday Book Review as one of the most sought after out-of-print books\
  \ of 2013.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
